## 👩🏻‍💻 Hello, World! I'm Peter Mölzer 🌍

Based in Berlin, currently honing my technical skills at the innovative **[42 Berlin](https://www.42network.org/)** programming school.

Originally from Genoa, Italy 🇮🇹🇦🇹, I hold a **Bachelor of Science in Economics** from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. My fascination with how technology—particularly AI—can transform data into actionable insights led me from analyzing markets and building strategic partnerships at companies like **Klarna** and **Clark** to diving deep into code.

My goal is to bridge the gap between business strategy and technical execution, building impactful software solutions.

### 🚀 My Current Focus at 42 Berlin

At 42, I'm immersed in a project-based curriculum, tackling challenges in:
*   **Core Programming:** Algorithms, Data Structures, C, C++
*   **Systems Engineering:** Linux Kernel, Virtual Machines, Docker Containerization
*   **Networking Fundamentals:** IP Addressing, Subnetting, Routing
*   **Development Practices:** Shell Scripting, Git/Version Control, Agile Methodologies (via peer learning, code reviews, pair programming)

*   ### 🌱 What I'm Learning / Working On

*   Currently deep in development on **a full-stack web application for tracking personal finance, with data analysis tool using AI**.
*   This project involves:
    *   Building the frontend with **React / Next.js** and **TypeScript**.
    *   Developing the backend logic using **C++**.
    *   Managing data with **MongoDB**.
    *   Containerizing the application environment using **Docker**.
    *   Implementing version control best practices with **Git** and GitHub.
*   This is a fantastic opportunity to apply concepts learned at 42 Berlin, particularly in system design, efficient algorithms, and collaborative development, while strengthening my skills across the full technology stack.

### 🎸 Outside of Code

When I'm not at the keyboard, I enjoy reading, writing, playing the guitar, DJing, and exploring new places.
